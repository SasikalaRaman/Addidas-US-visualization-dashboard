dashboard

I have attached the link to my Tableau dashboard, which I recently published on Tableau Public.


As a Tableau Specialist, I excel in data modeling and database design, leveraging advanced SQL skills to proficiently extract, transform, and load substantial datasets. I adhere to data visualization best practices, ensuring the creation of compelling dashboards that effectively communicate intricate data insights to stakeholders.
